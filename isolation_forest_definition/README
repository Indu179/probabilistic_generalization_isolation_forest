The folder contains the files with definition of isolation forest. 
As isolation forest consists of isolation trees, an isolation tree consists of nodes. 
The treeGrower class family is responsible for creating of isolation trees.
The class TreeGrowerBasic implements creating of standard Isolation Forest in the form of the method growForest().
The methods get_rot_operator and get_border are responsible for random selection of axis and the split value. 

Creating child classes of TreeGrowerBasic with overriden methods get_rot_operator and get_border we can introduce modifications without changing main pipeline of isolation tree creation.

The class TreeGrowerGeneralized overrides the get_border method. The modification is described in detail in the article.
The class TreeGrowerGeneralized is abstract. It has two abstract methods: integratedProbabilityDensity and probabilityDensity. They have to be implemented in the child classes.

The class TreeGrowerGeneralizedUniform is the child class, which utilizes uniform kernel for generating split value. It only implements the methods probabilityDensity integratedProbabilityDensity. The rest of behaviour stays unchanged.
